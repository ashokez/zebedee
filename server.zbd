# Uncomment the following line to log messages to a file
#
#  logfile './server.log'
#
# Or to log to the system logging facility uncomment this:
#
#  logfile SYSLOG

# Uncomment the following line if you want to use a fixed private
# key stored in a static file. The file should contain a line of
# the form "privatekey hexadecimal-key-string"
#
#  include './server.key'

keygenlevel 2		# Generate maximum strength private keys

# To validate the identity of clients uncomment the following
# line:
#
#  checkidfile './clients.id'

# Set up allowed redirection ports.
# These should be pretty safe -- but it's not a good idea
# to open up all ports.

redirect "telnet ftp"		# Basic services
redirect 5900-5999		# VNC traffic
redirect 6000-6010		# X Window System
redirect "daytime chargen"	# Ports useful for testing

targethost localhost		# Redirection is to the local machine
